# Sandpiper-Game
Repository for a sandpiper-based rogue-like.

### Overview/Ideas
A rogue like game centered around getting as far into the water as possible, to kill the [[giant crab]] and bring it to the other birds. 

### Game loop
The player starts at their [[home]], the beach, and can go out to find [[items]] and [[food]].
Food is found under the waves, but you must retreat when the waves come in.
You can find items that help you to in this process, and to fend off against enemies.
Some items help to get deeper into the ocean, and others just give [[points]].

You can end the day at any point by going home and purchasing one [[token]] from the [[shop]]. 
The shop allows you to end the day by purchasing a [[token]].
The shop is available at each [[home]] and has a variety of upgrades. 

Your home is where you end the day and respawn on death.
The first home is on the beach, then a rock after the barrier, followed by a cave in chest height water.
[[items]] can be stored in your home.

Awarded by [[food]] and used in the [[shop]].

### Waves
Waves, or depth, show progression through the game.
You start on land, and can go to shore waves, which need [[items]] to survive in without needing to run back.
The progression is as follows:

1. Shore waves
2. Shallow waves
3. Ankle waves
4. Barrier wave
5. Ankle waves
6. Knee deep
7. Chest height
8. Too deep to touch
9. Depths
