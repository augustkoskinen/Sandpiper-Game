# Sandpiper-Game
Repository for a sandpiper-based rogue-like.

# Overview/Ideas
A rogue like game centered around getting as far into the water as possible, to kill the [[giant crab]] and bring it to the other birds. 

### Game loop
The player starts at their [[home]], the beach, and can go out to find [[items]] and [[food]]. Food is found under the waves, but you must retreat when the waves come in. You can find items that help you to in this process, and to fend off against enemies. Some items help to get deeper into the ocean, and others just give [[points]]. You can end the day at any point by going home and purchasing one [[token]] from the [[shop]].
